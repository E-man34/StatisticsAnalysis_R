```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

include = FALSE significa non stampare il codice R quando si crea il markdown
il resto del codice non so a che cazzo serva ma faccio copia e incolla

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x<-rexp(100)
x
qqnorm(x)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
hist(x, freq=F, col="yellow", main="Exponential density")
```
